In the instant matter, the defendant is accountable for a total of 7,002 grams of heroin (6 kilograms seized by authorities and 1,002 grams in heroin transactions) and 1,958 grams of fentanyl (in addition to $50,000 in drug proceeds seized by CSP on June 9, 2016).  The heroin is equal to 7,002 kilograms of Converted Drug Weight and the fentanyl is equal to 4,895 kilograms of Converted Drug Weight, for a total of 11,897 kilograms of Converted Drug Weight.  Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3), for offenses involving at least 10,000 kilograms but less than 30,000 kilograms of Converted Drug Weight, the base offense level is 34.
